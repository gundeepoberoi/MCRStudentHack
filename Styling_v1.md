about.tsx: 
1. Would it be possible to make the image and text in About have the same horizontal level? Right now, the image is slightly higher than the paragraph
2. 


schedule.tsx: 
1. Change font size of schedule from 4xl to 5xl (Consistent with About)
2. Add text-lg to Event 1, Event 2, Event 3 (Consistent with About)
3. Change font size of 12th March from 7xl to 4xl (It should not be larger than the heading "Schedule" and "About" so either make the headings bigger or make the date smaller; Personally, I think the headings are already big enough but I am not good at design)
4. Add py-7 to the heading "Schedule" such that the headings "About" and "Schedule" will have the same distance to the <div></div> below them
5. 


faq.tsx: 
1. Change font size of "Frequently Asked Questions" from 2xl to 5xl (Consistent with About)
2. Suggestion: Should we change the font size of > next to the question from text-xl to text-lg to match the question text style? 
3. Change font size of subheading "Answer" from 2xl to 4xl (Consistent with 12th March)
4. Add text-lg to the contents under subheading "Answer"
5.
